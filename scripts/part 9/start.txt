Hi there.

You will probalbly remember us.

We are agends of the International
Pokemon Agency, but also double
agents working for Team Magma!

Nobody suspected us leaking
classified information about the
agency all this time...

Cutting right to the point, I got
to admit you got very far, but
that ends here!

Each of the next rooms lead to our
BOSS, but you need to collect 3
shards to open the final door.

Each one of us has his own 3
shards hidden in his room.

So, you only need to pass through
one room to advance, but that
won't be so easy.

Prepare yourself! We will be
waiting to the other side of our
rooms, if you ever make it there.

Good luck.
